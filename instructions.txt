Datatypes:
Integer (Like an int)
Decimal (Like a float)
PreciseDecimal (Like a double)

You can do Integer x = 23; or Integer and then x = 12; or Integer(12)

Output Usage:
disp(variable or "text");

//Nicer Alternate Method
output << variable <<variable2;

Input Usage:
input >> variable;

Arithmetic:

Ability to multiply, add, subtract, divide, between same datatype variables; Z = X * Y
Ability to add, subtract, ==,!= between my datatypes and a number; in form Integer - 1;     Not Reversible.
= Should work for both within same datatypes. Integer x = Integer y (remove Integer), Integer x = 2;
% Works for a datatype and an integer. X%12;

If statements:

Begins with a tppIF, if you are done you must type END. Otherwise, continue the chain with a tppELSEIF or tppELSE
Once the chain ends, type END. you can do disp(newline) to go to a new line.

It ain't much but it's honest work
