# TPP
C++ Project, Due: May 4, 2023
The goal of this programming assignment was to provide an opportunity for students to gain hands-on experience with computer architecture and programming. The task is to design and implement a program that simulates a CPU by creating a set of classes that emulate the behavior of basic instructions, registers, accumulators, memory management, and input/output devices.
